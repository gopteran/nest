## Overview

Ventus is the frontend repository for the Gopteran project — a sleek, modern interface built with SvelteKit designed to provide users with a fast, responsive, and intuitive experience.

It serves as the “wind beneath the wings” of the Gopteran ecosystem, delivering smooth navigation, real-time updates, and seamless interaction with the backend (Carina) and CLI agent (Remora).

## Why the name "Ventus"?

The name “Ventus” comes from the Latin word for “wind”:

- **Biological inspiration:**  
  Wind is an invisible but essential force for flight, enabling movement, lift, and navigation. It carries energy, connects environments, and is ever-present yet often unnoticed.

- **Architectural analogy:**  
  Ventus acts as the dynamic interface that carries user commands and feedback between the human operator and the backend infrastructure, making the experience effortless and fluid.

- **User-centric design:**  
  Like the wind, Ventus aims to be light, fast, and adaptive, focusing on user experience without adding unnecessary bulk or complexity. This is also why the choice of SvelteKit, a framework known for its minimalism and efficiency.

## Functional role

- **User Interface:** Provides a rich, interactive GUI for managing servers, services, and user accounts.  
- **Real-time Updates:** Integrates with backend APIs to deliver live status, notifications, and logs.  
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Designed for usability across devices and screen sizes.  
- **Extensibility:** Built on SvelteKit to support future enhancements, modular features, and theming.  
- **Secure Communication:** Interfaces securely with Carina and Remora to maintain system integrity.

## Design philosophy

Ventus embodies agility, clarity, and flow — it is the vibrant, user-facing breath of the Gopteran system. Its lightweight and responsive design reflects the unseen but critical role that wind plays in sustaining flight.

Ventus isn’t just a frontend — it’s the vital breeze that brings life and motion to the Gopteran experience, making complex operations feel effortless and natural.
