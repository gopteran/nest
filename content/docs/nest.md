## Overview

Nest is the documentation repository for the Gopteran project — the foundational hub where all knowledge, guides, and resources converge to support development and usage.

The name “Nest” symbolizes a safe, central place where everything essential comes together and grows. Like a bird’s nest that shelters and nurtures its young, this repo nurtures project knowledge, ensuring it’s accessible, organized, and preserved.

## Purpose

- Serve as the authoritative source for all Gopteran documentation  
- Support users and contributors with clear guides, tutorials, and references  
- Act as the content base for the official Gopteran documentation website

## Philosophy

In an ecosystem defined by flight and precision, the nest is the origin — the launchpad for everything that takes wing. By centralizing documentation here, we make sure that knowledge is protected and nurtured, enabling the project to thrive and evolve.

Choosing “Nest” highlights that documentation is not just support material — it’s the heart of the project’s growth and sustainability.
