## Overview

Carina is the backend core of the Gopteran project — the authoritative command center that manages authentication, resource lifecycle, and API orchestration.

It serves as the structural backbone, providing a robust and secure API that empowers frontends, CLI tools, and integrations to coordinate and control servers and services reliably.

## Why the name "Carina"?

The name “Carina” is inspired by the keel bone of a bird’s sternum:

- **Biological inspiration:**
  The carina is the central keel bone in birds that anchors the powerful flight muscles necessary for sustained flight. It provides essential structural support and coordination for complex wing movements.

- **Architectural analogy:**
  Similarly, Carina acts as the backbone of the Gopteran system — the foundational core that holds everything together and coordinates all critical operations. Without it, the entire ecosystem would lose structure and power.

- **Central authority:**
  Just as the keel bone is central to flight, Carina is the central control plane, making authoritative decisions about user permissions, resource states, and command dispatching.

## Functional role

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Securely manages users, roles, and access control.
- **Resource Management:** Orchestrates creation, updating, and deletion of servers and related assets.
- **API Gateway:** Offers a consistent and extensible API for clients and integrations.
- **Communication Broker:** Dispatches commands to agents and processes responses.
- **Data Persistence:** Maintains reliable storage of configuration, logs, and audit data.
- **Event & Notification Handling:** Supports real-time updates and alerts for connected clients.
- **Security Enforcement:** Enforces validation and security best practices to protect system integrity.

## Design philosophy

Carina embodies strength, structure, and control — it is the reliable backbone that keeps the system cohesive and responsive. Its design prioritizes scalability, extensibility, and security to serve as a stable foundation for Gopteran’s growth.

This name and design concept make Carina not only a backend service but a vital pillar of the Gopteran ecosystem — the steadfast keel that keeps the project flying true.
