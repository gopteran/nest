## Overview

Aerie is the fullstack control panel for the Gopteran project — an integrated, ready-to-use management interface combining frontend and backend functionality.

The name “Aerie” refers to the nest or dwelling of a bird of prey, typically located high on a cliff or tree, providing a commanding vantage point. This metaphor perfectly captures the panel’s role as the central command hub where administrators oversee and control their infrastructure with clarity and power.

## Purpose

- Provide an all-in-one control panel solution for users who want a seamless, integrated experience  
- Combine the responsive frontend and the robust backend into a unified application  
- Enable quick deployment and easy management without the need for separate frontend/backend setups

## Philosophy

Just as an aerie offers a high, secure vantage point for birds to watch over their territory, this control panel gives users a comprehensive and elevated view of their environment. It empowers administrators to manage complex systems efficiently and confidently from a single place.

By naming this repository “Aerie,” we emphasize the control panel’s role as a strategic and commanding interface — a place from which users can take flight and maintain dominance over their infrastructure.
